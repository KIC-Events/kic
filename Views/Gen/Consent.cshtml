      KIC Statement of Consent
    </h1>
    <div class="content body-text">
      <h2>KIC Events Consent & Conduct Policy</h2>
      <p>At KIC Events, consent is the foundation of everything we do. We are committed to maintaining a safe, informed, and welcoming space where all individuals can explore and express themselves freely, without fear of coercion, discrimination, or harm.</p>

      <h3>Consent Statement:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent is SEXY, and Consent is MANDATORY</strong></li>
        <li>We seek enthusiastic consent – clear headed, mutual, informed co-creation of a “YES” without manipulation or coercion.</li>
        <li>It is not an absence of a “NO”.</li>
        <li>No means no. It is a complete sentence, no explanation is needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>KIC Safety Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We have event volunteers, Dungeon Monitors (DMs) who wear yellow vests, and Managers on Duty (MOD) who wear a MOD nametag, who work to keep everyone safe.</li>
        <li>DMs and MODs do not see all things all the time, so we are a “see something, say something” group, who share concerns, so they can be addressed.</li>
        <li>We practice Risk Aware Consensual Kink (R.A.C.K) and Safe, Sane, Consensual (S.S.C.) decisions.</li>
        <li>Our safewords are RED and SAFEWORD, and we stop any scene when they are used.</li>
        <li>We do not interrupt people who are in a scene, or doing aftercare (except MODs / DMs), unless there are safety concerns that need immediately addressed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Community Conduct & Respect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We clean up after ourselves after a scene, and after eating or drinking.</li>
        <li>We use barriers on non-play furniture for naked juicy body parts.</li>
        <li>We use barriers to protect the furniture and on the floor when we play with wax.</li>
        <li>We honor posted time limits on play equipment.</li>
        <li>We ask for permission before we touch someone’s body, or someone’s things, unless we have previously negotiated otherwise.</li>
        <li>We respect each others’ privacy at KIC events, and in the world outside our events.</li>
        <li>We dress as “grandma vanilla” when we enter and leave public spaces.</li>
        <li>We do our best to keep airborne irritants (like tobacco smoke or other scents) outside of our events, to help attendees with allergies.</li>
        <li>We do not use phones, cameras, or recording devices unless an area is explicitly posted as being available to do so.</li>
        <li>No alcohol, drugs, illegal substances and/or firearms may be brought to a KIC Event.</li>
        <li>Any activity illegal in the State of Ohio or the US is prohibited at KIC Events. This includes soliciting, prostituting, negotiating payment for play or sexual services, use or sale of substances, etc.</li>
        <li>No firearms or weapons intended to cause physical harm are allowed at KIC events.</li>
        <li>KIC Events will not knowingly allow attendees to attend any function who have been convicted of a violent or sexual crime and/or are registered sex offenders.</li>
      </ul>
