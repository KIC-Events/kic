      <strong>Consent is the Foundation of Everything We Do</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Consent is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Freely given.</li>
      <li>Revocable.</li>
      <li>Informed.</li>
      <li>Enthusiastic.</li>
      <li>Sober.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide a safe space for all alternative lifestyles, to express themselves in their kink,
      sexuality, and relationships as they see fit, while continuing to educate on consent, negotiation, and other
      skills/fetishes/kinks in the BDSM lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe strongly in the “law of mobility” and “your kink may not be their kink, and that’s ok”. If you see
      something you do not like, simply walk away. Be respectful and courteous to their space by keeping comments to
      yourself, as you would want to be done to you and your space. Keep an open, non-judgmental mind, try things, learn what you can, and
      expand your mind to new possibilities.
    </p>

      KIC aims for a safe space for all attendees to come together to express themselves and negotiate full consent of
      their desires. KIC supports fully aware, informed, consensual negotiations and the principles of SSC (Safe, Sane,
      and Consensual)as well as RACK (Risk Aware Consensual Kink). We also recognize RED and SAFEWORD as universal
      safe words. No means No. It is a complete sentence, no explanations are needed.

      Kink In Columbus is a group local to Columbus Ohio, specializing in hosting alternative lifestyle education
      and play events. KIC Events was created by two local kinksters, who enjoy all the aspects that living an
      alternative lifestyle offers. Be it polyamory/ethical non-monogamy relationships to kink/BDSM. This group welcomes all
      walks of the lifestyle and encourages people to express themselves in whatever their kink is.
    </p>
    <p>
      KIC Events desires to create an environment of learning, excitement, inclusion, and support using our knowledge
      from being staff and volunteering at past events hosted by Adventures in Sexuality, Guilty Pleasures, and the
      Columbus Space. KIC Events will include education, demo stations, space to express yourself sexually, and
      furniture from AISKink Labs and Guilty Pleasures to play on.

      A space for kinksters has been missing since the Pandemic and we want to bring our community together one
      party at a time. Helping to rebuild and grow the community, connection, energies that come from in person
      events. Come KIC it with us and see for yourself.
